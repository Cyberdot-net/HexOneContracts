# Hex One Protocol

## What Is Hex One Protocol

Hex One Protocol is a stablecoin backed by __HEX__ t-shares

## How Hex One Works?

Participants can deposit __HEX__ which creates a t-share through the Hex One protocol, and allows the user to borrow the same _dollar_-value as initially deposited. To claim the collateral, depositors must wait until maturity to claim the t-share and they must also burn the initial borrowed $HEX1 amount.
