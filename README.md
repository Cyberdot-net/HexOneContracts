# Hex One Protocol

## What Is Hex One Protocol

Hex One Protocol is a stablecoin backed by __HEX__ t-shares

## How Hex One Works?

Participants can deposit __HEX__ which creates a t-share through the Hex One protocol, and allows the user to borrow the same _dollar_-value as initially deposited. To claim the collateral, depositors must wait until maturity to claim the t-share and they must also burn the initial borrowed $HEX1 amount.

## Hex One Workflow

Depositors initially forego T-SHARES in order to mint $HEX1. After acquiring the token, it can be used to purchase HEX or to provide liquidity. 
By pairing $HEX1 with highly liquid tokens such as HEX, USDC, etc, we're looking to increase the price stability of the token, and substantially reduce slippage.

Hex One protocol offers two main features: 

1. __Claimable Hex__, which means depositors may face liquidations if the collateral ratio goes below the liquidation ratio.
2. __Unclaimable Hex__, which represents future $HEX already pre-committed to increasing the Hex One protocol vault. This means the depositor does not expect to withdraw $HEX but to keep retrieving more $HEX1 as the prior t-shares maturity is reached.
Once $HEX1 is added to a liquidity pool, the LP can be staked and it will yield both $HEX and $HEXIT, Hex One Protocol's Incentive Token ($HEXIT).
